# Mav Bot - Jackson Hole Outdoor Guide

## Description of Design

Mav Bot was buit to help users find interesting outdoor adventures in the Jackson Hole area.  Often people have to rely on other forms of information to learn about fun and interesting places.  Mav Bot aims to elliminate one step of the process by allowing people to ask specific questions about "what they can do?"  The conversational logic will continue to be improved as time passes and more learning takes place.

## Key Technologies

The key technologies used in this project are html, css, JavaScript and jQuery.  The bot conversation uses the [Cleverscript](http://www.cleverscript.com/) Software.  A special thanks to Cleverscript for creating interesting and useful software.  The database and storage of all conversational information is wrapped up in the Cleverscript Software package.  Excel spreadsheets are used to update and store the conversational information that is unique to this particular bot project.

The automated typing that appears on the landing page is a library created by [Matt Bolt](http://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/).  A special thanks to him for creating an open source and free library.  The automated scrolling utilizes the .animate jQuery method.

All of the videos that have been added to this website are called from a Youtube API set-up as a static query in the app.js file.
